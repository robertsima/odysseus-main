"""Issue #2756 — a native web_search function call must preserve time_filter.

The web_search schema advertises a time_filter enum and the executor honors it
when content is JSON {"query","time_filter"}, but function_call_to_tool_block's
web_search branch emitted a bare query string and dropped time_filter. These pin
that a valid filter is passed through as JSON, while plain/invalid cases stay a
bare string (back-compat).
