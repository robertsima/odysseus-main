"""Local text models can leak web_search calls as prose plus bare JSON.

gpt-oss-20b sometimes writes:

    Need to do web_search for ...
    {"query":"...", "time_filter":"week"}

That is an intended tool call in non-native/textual tool mode, but older parsing
only recognized fenced blocks, [TOOL_CALL], XML invoke, and tool_code markup.
